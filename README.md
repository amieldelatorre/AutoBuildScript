# AutoBuildScript

Bash script auto updating / pulling changes from a remote repository & also building a dotnet project.

This was made with the intention of CI, making sure that changes at least are able to build successfully and don't break in that sense.

Made to run on linux servers, could be set as a cron job.

Make sure to change the config at the top of AutoBuildScript.sh and AutoPullScript.sh
